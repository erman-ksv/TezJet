# TezJet API

TezJet is a rural taxi hailing backend with OTP registration, single-session JWT
authentication, an anti-fraud location gate, FIFO driver queuing, Point C seat
locks, Point D route pooling, and Socket.io realtime events.

## Natural-language addresses

TezJet can use the Google Gemini API to turn a phrase such as
`Корасув, рядом со школой` into a structured address:

- `POST /api/addresses/normalize`
  - Body: `{ "address": "..." }`
  - Requires a TezJet bearer token.
  - Returns normalized locality, street, house number, landmarks, optional
    coordinates, confidence, and uncertainty notes.

Passenger orders may also include `pickup_address`. The normalized result is
stored in the order as `pickup_address`, while `pickup_location` remains the
authoritative GPS coordinate and still passes the anti-fake GPS middleware.

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a Replit Secret. The optional `GEMINI_MODEL` environment
variable overrides the default `gemini-3.6-flash` model. API keys are never
returned in responses or written to source files.

## Run

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev
```

The managed workflow supplies `PORT`. Set `SESSION_SECRET` for production. The
in-memory adapter is intentional for a runnable API scaffold; replace
`src/store/memoryStore.ts` with a PostgreSQL/Redis adapter when deploying
multi-instance workers.

## Authentication

1. `POST /api/auth/request-otp`
   - Body: `{ "phone_number": "+7 777 123 45 67", "full_name": "...", "role": "passenger|driver", "locale": "kk|uz|ru" }`
   - Development responses include `demo_code`; production responses never expose the OTP.
2. `POST /api/auth/login` or `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`
   - Body: `{ "phone_number": "...", "code": "123456" }`
   - Every successful login increments the session version and invalidates all earlier JWTs.
3. Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to protected routes.

`PATCH /api/auth/profile` only accepts locale changes. `full_name` and
`phone_number` are locked after the first successful OTP registration.

## Queue and orders

- `GET /api/queue` — current FIFO queue, Pyatak zone and your position.
- `POST /api/queue/join` — driver joins within the configured Pyatak geofence.
- `PATCH /api/queue/location` — location update checked by anti-fake GPS middleware.
- `PATCH /api/queue/status` — `searching`, `picking_up`, `en_route_to_c`, `arrived_at_c`, `in_transit`.
- `GET /api/fares/stops?route_id=pyatak` — route-stop catalog and `price_per_stop`.
- `POST /api/fares/estimate` — calculate
  `ceil(abs(destination_position - pickup_position)) * price_per_stop`.
  It accepts `{ "route_id": "pyatak", "pickup_stop": "C",
  "destination_stop": "D" }` or the legacy `{ "route_stops": ["C", "D"] }`.
- `POST /api/orders` — passenger creates a Point C or Point D order. Optional
  `route_stops` uses the same route catalog; when omitted, the pickup point is
  used as the pickup and destination stop, with a minimum one-stop fare.
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/accept` — #1 driver accepts; Point C gets a 7-minute seat lock.
- `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/status` — driver advances `en_route_to_c` → `arrived_at_c` → `in_transit` → `completed`.
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/cancel` — passenger or assigned driver cancels.

Point D orders are offered to the first in-transit driver with enough seats.
Driver-facing order responses mask passenger phone numbers.

The default route has two stops, Point C and Point D, and a price of 500 KZT
per stop. Admins can change the price and stops at runtime through `/api/admin`.
Set `REQUIRE_DRIVER_APPROVAL=true` to block unapproved drivers from joining
the queue. Admin OTP registration is enabled only when `ADMIN_PHONE` is set.

### Admin API

Admin JWTs can manage the route catalog:

- `GET|POST /api/admin/routes`
- `PATCH|DELETE /api/admin/routes/:routeId`
- `POST /api/admin/routes/:routeId/stops`
- `PATCH|DELETE /api/admin/routes/:routeId/stops/:stopId`
- `GET /api/admin/drivers`
- `PATCH /api/admin/drivers/:driverId/approval` with
  `{ "status": "pending|approved|rejected" }`

## Realtime and push-ready events

Socket.io connects to the same server with:

```js
io({ path: "/api/socket.io", auth: { token: accessToken } });
```

The server emits:

- `incoming_order` — `{ priority: "high", sound: "incoming_order.mp3", order }`
- `order:status`
- `queue:snapshot` — initial queue state on connection
- `queue:update`
- `queue:joined`, `queue:left`, `queue:status`, `queue:location`
- `queue:position` — private position update for each driver
- `queue:reordered` — emitted when FIFO ordering may have changed

Use `GET /api/notifications/config` for client notification settings,
`POST /api/notifications/devices` to register a push token, and
`POST /api/notifications/test-alert` to verify the high-priority client path.
