# TezJet API

TezJet is a rural taxi hailing backend with OTP registration, single-session JWT
authentication, an anti-fraud location gate, FIFO driver queuing, Point C seat
locks, Point D route pooling, and Socket.io realtime events.

## Natural-language addresses

TezJet can use the Google Gemini API to turn a phrase such as
`Корасув, рядом со школой` into a structured address:

- `POST /api/addresses/normalize`
  - Body: `{ "address": "..." }`
  - Requires a TezJet bearer token.
  - Returns normalized locality, street, house number, landmarks, optional
    coordinates, confidence, and uncertainty notes.

Passenger orders may also include `pickup_address`. The normalized result is
stored in the order as `pickup_address`, while `pickup_location` remains the
authoritative GPS coordinate and still passes the anti-fake GPS middleware.

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a Replit Secret. The optional `GEMINI_MODEL` environment
variable overrides the default `gemini-3.6-flash` model. API keys are never
returned in responses or written to source files.

## Run

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev
```

The managed workflow supplies `PORT`. Set `SESSION_SECRET` for production. The
in-memory adapter is intentional for a runnable API scaffold; replace
`src/store/memoryStore.ts` with a PostgreSQL/Redis adapter when deploying
multi-instance workers.

## Authentication

1. `POST /api/auth/request-otp`
   - Body: `{ "phone_number": "+7 777 123 45 67", "full_name": "...", "role": "passenger|driver", "locale": "kk|uz|ru" }`
   - Development responses include `demo_code`; production responses never expose the OTP.
2. `POST /api/auth/login` or `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`
   - Body: `{ "phone_number": "...", "code": "123456" }`
   - Every successful login increments the session version and invalidates all earlier JWTs.
3. Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to protected routes.

`PATCH /api/auth/profile` only accepts locale changes. `full_name` and
`phone_number` are locked after the first successful OTP registration.

## Queue and orders

- `GET /api/queue` — current FIFO queue and your position.
- `POST /api/queue/join` — driver joins within 150 m of the configured queue point.
- `PATCH /api/queue/location` — location update checked by anti-fake GPS middleware.
- `PATCH /api/queue/status` — `searching`, `picking_up`, `en_route_to_c`, `arrived_at_c`, `in_transit`.
- `POST /api/orders` — passenger creates a Point C or Point D order.
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/accept` — #1 driver accepts; Point C gets a 7-minute seat lock.
- `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/status` — driver advances `en_route_to_c` → `arrived_at_c` → `in_transit` → `completed`.
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/cancel` — passenger or assigned driver cancels.

Point D orders are offered to the first in-transit driver with enough seats.
Driver-facing order responses mask passenger phone numbers.

## Realtime and push-ready events

Socket.io connects to the same server with:

```js
io({ path: "/api/socket.io", auth: { token: accessToken } });
```

The server emits:

- `incoming_order` — `{ priority: "high", sound: "incoming_order.mp3", order }`
- `order:status`
- `queue:update`

Use `GET /api/notifications/config` for client notification settings,
`POST /api/notifications/devices` to register a push token, and
`POST /api/notifications/test-alert` to verify the high-priority client path.
