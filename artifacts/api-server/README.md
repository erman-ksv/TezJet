# TezJet API

TezJet is a rural taxi hailing backend with OTP registration, single-session JWT
authentication, an anti-fraud location gate, FIFO driver queuing, Point C seat
locks, Point D route pooling, and Socket.io realtime events.

## Natural-language addresses

TezJet can use the Google Gemini API to turn a phrase such as
`Корасув, рядом со школой` into a structured address:

- `POST /api/addresses/normalize`
  - Body: `{ "address": "..." }`
  - Requires a TezJet bearer token.
  - Returns normalized locality, street, house number, landmarks, optional
    coordinates, confidence, and uncertainty notes.

Passenger orders may also include `pickup_address`. The normalized result is
stored in the order as `pickup_address`, while `pickup_location` remains the
authoritative GPS coordinate and still passes the anti-fake GPS middleware.

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a Replit Secret. The optional `GEMINI_MODEL` environment
variable overrides the default `gemini-3.6-flash` model. API keys are never
returned in responses or written to source files.

## Run

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev
```

The managed workflow supplies `PORT`. Set `SESSION_SECRET` for production. For another market, set the ISO country and ISO 4217 currency explicitly. Production must use an approved `MARKET_PRICE_PER_STOP`; never reuse a tariff from another currency without a business-approved price. Storage selection is explicit:

- Tests use the in-memory adapter.
- Development uses in-memory storage by default. To test PostgreSQL, set `TEZJET_STORAGE_ADAPTER=postgres` and `DATABASE_URL`.
- Production refuses to start unless `TEZJET_STORAGE_ADAPTER=postgres` and `DATABASE_URL` are configured; it will not silently run with volatile in-memory data.

For an existing database that still has the legacy `price_per_stop_kzt` column, perform an explicit migration before deploying this version. This preserves existing amounts as KZT and intentionally does not convert them to UZS:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "tezjet_routes" RENAME COLUMN "price_per_stop_kzt" TO "price_per_stop";
ALTER TABLE "tezjet_routes" ADD COLUMN "currency" text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'KZT';
```

After the migration, review each route's currency and set a business-approved tariff for the target market. Existing KZT rows are not automatically re-labelled as UZS. A PostgreSQL database whose stored route currency differs from `MARKET_CURRENCY` will refuse startup until the route is explicitly reconciled.

Provision the PostgreSQL database and apply the current Drizzle schema before enabling the PostgreSQL adapter:

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
```

CI now provisions PostgreSQL, applies the Drizzle schema, runs the API regression scenarios against the PostgreSQL adapter, verifies that users and orders survive an API process restart, and tests concurrent duplicate acceptance of the same order. Order acceptance and the corresponding queue update run in one database transaction. Before production launch, continue reviewing transaction boundaries for cancellation, status transitions, and seat-lock expiration, and complete deployment-specific security and load testing.

## Release scenario checks

Run the API regression scenarios from the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm test
```

The check builds the API, starts an isolated test server, and verifies OTP
registration and login session invalidation, FIFO driver queue behavior, Point
C seat locks and status transitions, Point D pooling, and Socket.io realtime
events. It uses development OTP responses and does not require external
services.

## Authentication

1. `POST /api/auth/request-otp`
   - Body: `{ "phone_number": "+7 777 123 45 67", "full_name": "...", "role": "passenger|driver", "locale": "kk|uz|ru" }`
   - Development responses include `demo_code`; production responses never expose the OTP.
2. `POST /api/auth/login` or `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`
   - Body: `{ "phone_number": "...", "code": "123456" }`
   - Every successful login increments the session version and invalidates all earlier JWTs.
3. Send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to protected routes.

`PATCH /api/auth/profile` only accepts locale changes. `full_name` and
`phone_number` are locked after the first successful OTP registration.

## Queue and orders

- `GET /api/queue` — current FIFO queue, Pyatak zone and your position.
- `POST /api/queue/join` — driver joins within the configured Pyatak geofence.
- `PATCH /api/queue/location` — location update checked by anti-fake GPS middleware.
- `PATCH /api/queue/status` — `searching`, `picking_up`, `en_route_to_c`, `arrived_at_c`, `in_transit`.
- `GET /api/fares/stops?route_id=pyatak` — route-stop catalog and `price_per_stop`.
- `POST /api/fares/estimate` — calculate
  `ceil(abs(destination_position - pickup_position)) * price_per_stop`.
  It accepts `{ "route_id": "pyatak", "pickup_stop": "C",
  "destination_stop": "D" }` or the legacy `{ "route_stops": ["C", "D"] }`.
- `POST /api/orders` — passenger creates a Point C or Point D order. Optional
  `route_stops` uses the same route catalog; when omitted, the pickup point is
  used as the pickup and destination stop, with a minimum one-stop fare.
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/accept` — #1 driver accepts; Point C gets a 7-minute seat lock.
- `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/status` — driver advances `en_route_to_c` → `arrived_at_c` → `in_transit` → `completed`.
- `POST /api/orders/:orderId/cancel` — passenger or assigned driver cancels.

Point D orders are offered to the first in-transit driver with enough seats.
Driver-facing order responses mask passenger phone numbers.

The default route has two stops, Point C and Point D. Market selection uses `MARKET_COUNTRY` and `MARKET_CURRENCY` (defaults: `UZ` and `UZS`). Set `MARKET_PRICE_PER_STOP` to an approved positive integer before enabling a fare. The default UZS route remains inactive when no price is configured; the service never converts or guesses a UZS tariff from the former 500 KZT demo price. Admins can change route prices and stops at runtime through `/api/admin`.
Set `REQUIRE_DRIVER_APPROVAL=true` to block unapproved drivers from joining
the queue. Admin OTP registration is enabled only when `ADMIN_PHONE` is set.

### Admin API

Admin JWTs can manage the route catalog:

- `GET|POST /api/admin/routes`
- `PATCH|DELETE /api/admin/routes/:routeId`
- `POST /api/admin/routes/:routeId/stops`
- `PATCH|DELETE /api/admin/routes/:routeId/stops/:stopId`
- `GET /api/admin/drivers`
- `PATCH /api/admin/drivers/:driverId/approval` with
  `{ "status": "pending|approved|rejected" }`
- `GET /api/admin/queue-point` — read the current Pyatak center and 150-meter geofence.
- `PATCH /api/admin/queue-point` — update the center from the admin panel with
  `{ "lat": 41.3111, "lng": 69.2797 }` or `{ "center": { "lat": 41.3111, "lng": 69.2797 } }`.

The queue point update requires an admin JWT. Coordinates are validated before
being applied, and the new center is used immediately by driver queue joins,
location updates, queue status responses, and realtime queue events. The current
in-memory adapter keeps this setting until the API process restarts.

## FIFO queue and active-trip pooling

When a driver accepts an order that uses all remaining seats, the driver is
removed from the FIFO queue immediately. When the driver changes the order
status to `in_transit` (the "Go" action), the driver is removed from FIFO even
if seats remain available. The active-trip record keeps the remaining seats and
active order IDs, so Point D pooling can offer new passengers to that driver
without changing the FIFO order of drivers who are still waiting.

The current runnable adapter models the Redis design with an `inFifo` flag on
the queue entry. A Redis-backed adapter should map FIFO membership to a sorted
set and keep active-trip entries in a separate collection.

## Realtime and push-ready events

Socket.io connects to the same server with:

```js
io({ path: "/api/socket.io", auth: { token: accessToken } });
```

The server emits:

- `incoming_order` — `{ priority: "high", sound: "incoming_order.mp3", order }`
- `order:status`
- `queue:snapshot` — initial queue state on connection
- `queue:update`
- `queue:joined`, `queue:left`, `queue:status`, `queue:location`
- `queue:position` — private position update for each driver
- `queue:reordered` — emitted when FIFO ordering may have changed

Use `GET /api/notifications/config` for client notification settings,
`POST /api/notifications/devices` to register a push token, and
`POST /api/notifications/test-alert` to verify the high-priority client path.
